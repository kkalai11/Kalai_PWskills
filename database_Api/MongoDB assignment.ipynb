    "#Ans: MongoDB is a cross-platform, document-oriented database that provides, high performance, high availability, and easy scalability. MongoDB works on the concept of collections and documents. Non-relational databases are also known as NoSQL databases.\n",
    " Non-relational databases are preferred when the data is unstructured and complex, and when the data is growing exponentially. "

    "#Q2. State and Explain the features of MongoDB.\n",
    "#Ans: MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents. \n",
    " It is a document-oriented database designed for ease of development and scaling. The database is part of the MongoDB product, which is a general purpose, document-based, distributed database built for modern application developers and for the cloud era. \n",
    "MongoDB features include:\n",
    "#1. Ad hoc queries: MongoDB supports search by field, range queries, regular expression searches. Queries can return specific fields of documents and also include user-defined JavaScript functions.\n",
    "#2. Indexing: Any field in a MongoDB document can be indexed (indices in MongoDB are conceptually similar to those in RDBMS). Secondary indices are also available.\n",
    "#3. Replication: MongoDB provides high availability with replica sets. A replica set consists of two or more copies of the data. Each replica set member may act in the role of primary or secondary replica at any time. All writes and reads are done on the primary replica by default. Secondary replicas maintain a copy of the data of the primary using built-in replication.\n",
    "#4. Load balancing: MongoDB uses sharding to scale horizontally by distributing data across multiple servers. MongoDB can run over multiple servers, balancing the load and/or duplicating data to keep the system up and running in case of hardware failure."
