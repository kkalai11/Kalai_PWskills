    "# Q4. Explain REST and SOAP Architecture. Mention shortcomings of SOAP.\n",
    "REST (Representational State Transfer) and SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) are two popular web service communication architectures. REST is an architectural style that uses HTTP for communication and is often preferred for its simplicity and flexibility. SOAP, on the other hand, is a protocol that uses XML for communication and is more rigid and complex.\n",
    "REST Architecture:\n",
    "- Uses HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for communication\n",
    "- Uses URLs to identify resources\n",
    "- Supports multiple data formats (JSON, XML, etc.)\n",
    "- Stateless communication\n",
    "- Lightweight and simple\n",
    "SOAP Architecture:\n",
    "- Uses XML for communication\n",
    "- Uses a predefined set of rules and standards\n",
    "- Supports complex data structures and transactions\n",
    "- Stateful communication\n",
    "- More rigid and complex\n",
    "Shortcomings of SOAP:\n",
    "- Complexity: SOAP is more complex and requires more overhead compared to REST.\n",
    "- Performance: SOAP can be slower due to the additional processing required for XML parsing.\n",
    "- Scalability: SOAP can be less scalable due to its stateful nature and complex data structures.\n",
    "- Interoperability: SOAP can have compatibility issues between different platforms and languages.\n",
    "- Security: SOAP can have security vulnerabilities due to its complexity and flexibility.\n",
    "In summary, REST is preferred for its simplicity, flexibility, and performance, while SOAP is used for its support of complex data structures and transactions.\n"
